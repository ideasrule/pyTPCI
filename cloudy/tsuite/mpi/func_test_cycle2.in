# this produces a very large number of lines in the output mostly
# because Hbeta is very weak in hot gas.  Choose Lya as the normalization
# line to make line list smaller

This computes a series of models that check the temperature
through the S curve in the Fields et al. three-phase model of
ISM stability.
