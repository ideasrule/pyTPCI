## Notes

These are plots of results from various sims in tsuite done
using Jeremy Sanders' Veusz probram, http://home.gna.org/veusz/

The plots use the results of SAVE output files in the tsuite subdirectories.
Those files are created by running each sim to be plotted.

To generate new plots run the sims, open veusz, and do data / reload.
