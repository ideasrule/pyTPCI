This shows an S-curve calculation - the plots show the density as the X-axis.
The lower panel shows the gas temperature, which decreases for high densities
because of the lower ionizaiton parameter.
The gas pressure is the y-axis on the upper plot.
Three phases have the same pressure, with two of them stable.

The gas is ionized by the galactic background.  The density varies between
1e-3 and 100 cm-3.  This is the full range found in the diffuse ism.

Such calculations were once trendy in ISM studies, following the early
work by Field+69, http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/1969ApJ...155L.149F
It is now known that turbulent and magnetic pressures are important,
Heiles & Crutcher 2005, http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2005LNP...664..137H

The components that are produced are
CNM - cold neutral medium, density ~ 40 cm-3
WNM - n ~ 0.5 cm-3,
WIM - warm ionized medium, n ~ 0.25 cm-3
HIM - hot ionized medium, n ~ 1e-3 cm-3, calculation DOES NOT
      reproduce observed temperature of HIM - we get ~1e4K but
      observed is ~1e6 K.  HIM is shock, not photo, ionized
