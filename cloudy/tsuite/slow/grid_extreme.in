## >>chng 13 jul 25, wl from 4861A to 4861.36A, increased wl precision to 6 sig. fig.
## >>chng 17 may 26, wl from 4861.36A to 4861.33A, update Rydberg constant
## >>chng 20 aug 25, wl from 4861.33A to 4861.32A, switched from computed to tabulated energies for H and He isoseq
## >>chng 21 mar 17, wl from 4861.32A to 4861.33A, update NIST energies
## >>chng 21 apr 08, wl from 4861.33A to 4861.34A, update 1-e energies to np
## >>chng 21 aug 18, wl from 4861.34A to 4861.32A, revert to PvH energies for H
normalize to "Q(H)" 4861.32A
