title the Orion HII Region / PDR / Molecular cloud with an open geometry
#
# commands controlling continuum =========
# the incident continuum has two parts
# kurucz continuum with flux of photons striking cloud
# this is the the OVI star, its temperature and phi(H)
# this is the result of this command
# table star kurucz 39600 K
# and makes it possible to run these orion sims without
# installing the stellar atmosphere files 
table SED "star_kurucz_39600.dat" 
phi(H) 13
#
# this adds the observed hot brems
# its temperature (as log of T) and the flux of 
# photons striking the cloud
brems 6
phi(h) 10
#
# cosmic rays are important for pdr chemistry
cosmic rays, background
#
# commands controlling geometry  =========
# this turns off the stop temperature option
# so the sim will not stop due to temperature
stop temperature off
# this sets the thickness of the HII region & PDR
##>>chng 05 nov 22, change from 1 to 1/2 pc to avoid strong freeze out
## of molecules
stop thickness 0.5 linear parsec 
# this is typical of a gmc, larson 1981
# stop total hydrogen column density 22
# this will result in a milli gauss B-field in molecular region
magnetic field -5 gauss
# assume constant pressure
constant pressure 
##>>chng 05 nov 18, add this, NA add two ices
set nend 2500 
#
# other commands for details     =========
failures 3
# mimic existence of unmodeled molecular gas
double 
# iterate since lines optically thick
iterate
# set microturbulence in equipartition with B field
turbulence equipartition
# set the line width so lines appear on the save continuum
# set save line width 10 km/s
#
# commands for density & abundances =========
# this is the log of the initial H density, cm-3
hden 4
# this will speed up the calculation a bit
init file="ism.ini"
# this uses HII region abundances, but no grains
abundances hii region no grains
# this uses orion grains
grains orion
# turn on PAHs, with an abundance that depends on H0 fraction,
# as suggested by long-slit observations of Orion bar,
# with an abundance 3x larger than default built into the code
grains pah function 3 
# 
# commands controlling output    =========
# print lots of faint CO lines
print line faint -6
# normalize to Ha

# ========================================

Similar to orion_hii_pdr except for plane parallel geometry.
The properties of the molecular region change when details of the H+
region change because the pressure of the entire cloud can change
as a result.  The goal of this sim is an existence proof - that it can
be done, rather than the stable details of the molecular region.
