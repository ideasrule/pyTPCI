## Notes

This checks that the code is properly initialized when it sets up. 
Three different models are computed twice.  The punch results
output goes to file1.txt (the first set) and file2.txt (the second). 
The main output goes to comp4a.out and comp4b.out.  These pairs of
files should be exactly the same.  If they are not then a variable
is not properly initialized when the code is set up.
