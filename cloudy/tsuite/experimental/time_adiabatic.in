# commands for density & abundances =========
hden 1 linear
# thermal timescale is 9e10, this is much shorter so will
# approximate an adiabatic epansion
constant pressure time scale=1e8 power=-1
#
# commands controlling geometry  =========
set dr 0 
set nend 1

# other commands for details     =========
# the time dependent calculations will start on iteration 3
# first two are to relax the calculation
set dynamics relax 2
# number of time steps, should stop due to end of time, not this
iterate 60
# thermal timescale is 9e10 s so want this much sorter

test time dependent adiabatic expansion
Cooling time is 9e10 s, this test occurs over 1e10 s so should
be nearly adiabatic
