title test grain energy conservation
#
# commands controlling continuum =========
# the incident continuum is two parts
# star and flux of photons striking it
## >>chng 03 sep 12, now go deep into omc1 and cannot assume plane par geometry
# this is the photosphere of the OVI star, its temperature and Q(H)
# this is the result of this command
# table star kurucz 39600 K
# and makes it possible to run these orion sims without
# installing the stellar atmosphere files 
table SED nuFnu "star_kurucz_39600.dat" 
phi(H) 13
# this adds the observed hot brems, its temperature and the flux of 
# photons striking the cloud
brems 6
phi(h) 10
## >>chng 03 apr 30, add cosmic rays to model
# add cosmic rays, which are important in the pdr
cosmic rays, background
#
# commands controlling geometry  =========
# this sets the separation from the star and the face of the cloud
## >>chng 00 oct 13, from 50 to 10
## >>chng 04 nov 09, introduce off option
# this turns off the stop temperature opption
# the sim will not stop due to temperature
stop temperature off
# this is typical of a gmc, larson 1981
# stop total hydrogen column density 22
stop av 1000 
## >>chng 02 dec 21, change to set thickness, with new hmole
## co hits asymptote at 0.9 and so does not stop due to co
## >>chng 03 sep 12, co network cleaned up, reset thickness to
## 1 parsec, roughly the width of the cloud
# this sets the thickness of the HII region & PDR
##>>chng 05 nov 22, from 1 to 0.5 pc, so stop before ices fully form
# stop thickness 0.5 linear parsec 
## >>chng 01 dec 30, make constant gas pressure to avoid Lya rad pressure
# assume constant pressure
# constant gas pressure 
## >>chng 06 aug 21, make total pressure so like orion_hii_open
constant pressure 
# this will result in a milli gauss B-field in molecular region
magnetic field -5 gauss
# the orion environment full covers the star, so turn on sphere
sphere 
# we have a spherical geometry but want to simulate observing
# through a spectrometer's slit.  use the aperture
# command for this
aperture beam 
#
# other commands for details     =========
## >>chng 03 sep 12, add this command
# mimic existence of unmodeled molecular gas
double 
# iterate since lines optically thick
# iterate
# the observed microturbulence, partially a flow, so not included in pressure
turbulence 8 km/sec no pressure
# set the line width so lines appear on the save continuum
set save line width 10 km/s
# there should be no failures at all
failures 3
#
# this model goes quite deep, needs lots of zones
## >>chng 06 aug 12, do not let zoness become thick to IR grain emission
set nend 2200
#
# commands for density & abundances =========
# this is the log of the initial H density, cm-3
hden 4
# this will speed up the calculation a bit
init file="ism.ini"
# this uses HII region abundances, but no grains
abundances hii region no grains
# this turns on orion grains, but leaves quantum heating off to save time
grains orion no qheat
# turn on PAHs, with an abundance that depends on H0 fraction,
# as suggested by long-slit observations of Orion bar,
# with an abundance 3x larger than default built into the code
grains pah function 3 no qheat 
# 
# commands controlling output    =========
normalize to "O  1" 63.17m
# print lots of faint CO lines
print line faint -4
