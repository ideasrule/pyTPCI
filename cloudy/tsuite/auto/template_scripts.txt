Text after the first empty line are totally ignored and should be used
to explain the purpose of the sim and any special commands that may
have been used.  This should also describe what the sim is testing,
what is the essential physics to watch out for.

Each simulation is assigned to one or more classes.  The name of the class
appears on the line starting
# class NAMAE
a simulation may be assigned to more than one class.

Classes of models
blr - the BLR of AGN
coronal - coronal or collisional ionization equilibrium
dynamics - dynamics
function - test some special function of the code
geometry - different aspects of the geometry
hii - H II regions
igm - the intergalactic medium
ism - the interstellar medium
limit - test the code's behavior in extreme limits
nlr - the NLR of AGN
nova - nova shells or photospheres
optimizer - test whether the optimizer works
pdr - a PDR
pn - a planetary nebula
stars - use one of the stellar atmospheres
