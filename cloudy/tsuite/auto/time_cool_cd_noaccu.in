Test time dependent cooling at constant density.
In time_cool_cd.in, the line emission accumulation is done by default by mass.
In this sim, no accumulation is performed (see 'set cumulative' above).  The
final line fluxes are those of the last iteration.
This sim is meant simply to exercise the 'set cumulative off' command, so a
full run to low temperatures is deemed unnecessary.
