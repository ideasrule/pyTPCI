This runs the standard "test" case, and then creates
the line data and labels files.	 Test by itself includes
many asserts, so no further asserts are needed here.

The file func_lines.lab is a useful list of all lines predicted by the code.
Cut and paste this into other places when you need to find a particular
emission line.

The func_lines lines.dat gives atomic data for all the lines, and their
critical density at 10000 K.
The large H2 and Fe II model atoms are turned on to include their lines.
