This checks that the code goes to strict thermodynamic equilibrium
for the case of a metal rich gas exposed to a true black body. 
The many heavy element lines should dominate cooling, so this is
a test that the multilevel atoms go to LTE in the radiation-dominated limit.

Checks:
-	Temperature should equilibrate at 20000 K.  
-	Departure coefficients should equal unity.
