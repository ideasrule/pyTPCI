Test time dependent cooling at constant density.
In time_cool_cd.in, the line emission accumulation is done by default by mass.
In this sim, the accumulation is done by flux (see 'set cumulative' above).
This sim is meant simply to exercise the 'set cumulative flux' command, so a
full run to low temperatures is deemed unnecessary.
