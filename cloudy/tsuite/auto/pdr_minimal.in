# ========================================

This model is derived from the F4 model from the Leiden workshop (Roellig et
al. 2007, A&A, 467, 187). It has been reduced to a two-zone model in order to
test the ionization conditions at the face of the PDR. Older versions of the
code had a bug where the ionization in zone 1 was many dex lower than in zone
2. The conditions in zone 1 were wrong and should have been similar to the
conditions in zone 2. Here we test that the code doesn't regress. See also

The ionization in this sim is produced by continuum pumping of the metastable
levels of N I, followed by photoionization out of the metastable levels of N I.
See Ferland et al., 2012, ApJ, 757, 79. So this pumping and ionization mechanism
is also tested by this sim.
