This uses the grid command to compute line ratios for a wide range of
density and temperature.  The ionization is set to a uniform value and
only a few elements are included.  this makes the calculation faster
and prevents recombination [O III] 4363 from becoming important (there
is no O+3).

These are the line ratios mentioned as limits in the Johnstone et al.
Spitzer cooling flow filament paper (2007).
