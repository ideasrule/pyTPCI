# commands for density & abundances =========
# intended to make sim run as fast as possible
hden 8
no level 2 lines ## slight speed up - here for consistency with old ini file

element chlorine off
element argon off
#
# commands controlling geometry  =========
stop zone 1
set dr 0
#
# commands controlling output
# this produces a very large number of lines in the output mostly
# because Hbeta is very weak in hot gas.  Choose Lya as the normalization
# line to make line list smaller

This computes a series of models that check the temperature
through the S curve in the Fields et al. three-phase model of
ISM stability.
