# ========================================
# 


This is one of the test cases from the Lexington Meeting suite of nebulae. 
It is a grain-free HII region ionized by a very cool star.  Hydrogen is
ionized but not helium so this tests the transport of the H Lyman continuum. 
The set of lines is entered with the print line sum command to test
energy conservation.
