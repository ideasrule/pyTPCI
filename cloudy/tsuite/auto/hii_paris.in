# ========================================
# 

This is one of the "standard" models computed at the Paris and Lexington
meetings on photoionization and shock calculations.  a bable in hazy
compares the predictions of the current version of CLOUDY with predictions
of a few of the other codes.  It is necessary to iterate since some
fine structure lines are optically thick.   The set of lines entered
with the print line sum command is used to obtain the total luminosity
in detected lines, a measure of the Stoy temperature.

Checks:
