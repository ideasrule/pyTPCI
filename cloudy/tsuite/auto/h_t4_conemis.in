title continuous emission from H atom
#
# commands controlling continuum =========
# use laser so that stellar continuum is not in predicted continuum
laser 2
ionization -1
#
# commands for density & abundances =========
# high density to suppress two-photon emission
hden 8
init "honly.ini"
#
# commands controlling geometry  =========
# this thisckness is the inverse square of the density, so the
# total emission from the computed slab will in effect have the
# square of the density removed, so predictions will be j pi j / n_e n_p
stop thickness -16
#
# other commands for details     =========
# include a large number of levels to capture IR emission
# increase default resolution stored in continuum_mesh.ini 
set continuum resolution 0.1
iterate
constant temperature 4

# class limit 
# ========================================
# 

This tests the continuous emission from the model H atom.  The
gas temperature is 10000 K and the continuous emissivity
is asserted for a range of wavelengths.

This was used to generate the plot in Hazy 2 comparing the emission
from a pure hydrogen plasma with those of Ferland 1980.
