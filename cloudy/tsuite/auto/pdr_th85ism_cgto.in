#
# commands controlling continuum =========
# cosmic radiation background
background z=0
# cosmic ray background ionization and heating 
cosmic rays, background
# first continuum is FIR hot grain continuum produced in 
# unmodeled HII Region
blackbody, t = 75 K
intensity 2.7 (total)
# this is the attenuated hot stellar continuum
black 30000
intensity  2.204 range  0.4412 to 1 Ryd
# this will remove all ionizing radiation
extinguish 24 0
#
# commands controlling geometry  =========
# simulate effects of gas we do not model
double
# their turbulence
turbulence 2.7 km/sec
# stopping criteria
# this should be the one actually used
## >>chng 04 mar 13, bug in av, this asked for 10 and got 33.2,
## so keep same by changing stpo 
stop AV 33.2 extended 
# stop when gas is fully neutral
stop efrac -10
# stop when gas is cold
stop temperature 10 linear
# stop at thickness of 16.5 so that mole limit does not
# stop this calculation - that would make results very
# detail dependent
## >>chng 03 mar 08, from 16.5 to 16.3, so both th85orion, th85ism,
## stop for thickness, not C fully molecular
## >>chng 03 aug 28, stop at a few parsecs
stop thickness 19
#
# commands for density & abundances =========
hden 5.362
# this turns off some elements, and processes we don't need
# so needs to come before the elements 
init file="ism.ini"
# this is the TH85 mix except C is raised by 0.2 dex,
# and O lowered byt his amount, so that C/O > 1
## >>chng 05 mar 22, would not work with C of -3.32,
## lowered to -3.4 
abundances he= -1.01 c= -3.4 n=-8 o=-3.50 ne=-8 mg=-5.89
continue si= -6.10 s= -5.10 cl=-7 ar=-8 fe= -6.60
# use ism abundances but turn of quantum heating 
grains ism, abundance log 0.16 no qheat 
#
# other commands for details     =========
# must iterate since many FIR MIR lines are optically thick
iterate 
# this is a closed geometry, in Orion, veil covers 2pi sr
sphere
# make Lyman lines very optically thick, which stops pumping by
# Balmer continuum
## >>chng 16 apr 14, had been case B, this gets same effect with
## no large Lyman optical depths
Database H-like Lyman pumping off
# this should run cleanly - turn down number of allow conv fails
failures 3 
#
# commands controlling output    =========
normalize to "c  2" 157.636m 
# want the spectrum to be relative to this [C II] line
# uv lines are strongly pumped by stellar continuum, break out contribution
print line pump
print line optical depths
print ages

# ========================================
# 

This is the Tielens and Hollenbach (1985a, b) standard model of
the Orion photodissociation region (PDR) but with the C abundance
increased by 0.2 dex, and O lowered by this amount, so that C/O>1.
Specifically, this is their Table 2 of paper 2, ApJ 291,  p749.
The Database H-like Lyman pumping off command appears because the Lyman lines are
vastly optically thick in this environment. 
If the command is removed the Lyman lines will be optically thin,
which will result in fast fluorescent excitation of the
(nearly totally neutral) hydrogen atom.
