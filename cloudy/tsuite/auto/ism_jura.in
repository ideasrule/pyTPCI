# commands controlling continuum =========
# first continuum is FIR hot grain continuum produced in 
# unmodeled HII Region
blackbody, t = 75 K

This model started out life as the Tielens & Hollenbach 1985 pdr.  The
density was set to unity and the incident radiation field adjusted so
that the two default grains have temperatures near 100K.  The model
asserts that the H2 formation rate on grain surfaces is close to the

rate.
