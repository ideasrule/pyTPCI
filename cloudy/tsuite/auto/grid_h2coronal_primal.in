*********

This is a classical cooling function calculation - cosmic rays must be included
for temperatures below 1e4 K to sustain chemistry.
This is a coronal (collisional) ionization calculation.

This version uses primordial abundances.  A small CR rate has to be set 
for the low-T chemistry to work.  The possibility of primordial
cosmic rays is rays is mentioned by 2014A&A...570L...3T although
thiey are not part of standard primrodial chemistry networks.

This is not a realistic model for several reasons.  First, it uses the approximate
small H2 model - the large model invoked with ATOM H2 is better but slower.
Second, primordial chemistry is time dependent - the Universe is typically not
old enough, at a given z, for the chemistry to have reached steady state.
This is a time-steady calculation.

The purpose of the test is to demonstrate code behavior in the metal-free
limit, over a wide range of temperature.  Gas-phase light-element
chemistry is exercised, but with the trace amount of cosmic rays.
