*********

This is a classical cooling function calculation - cosmic rays must be included
for temperatures below 1e4 K to sustain the chemistry.
This is a coronal (collisional) ionization calculation.

It is a pair with grid_coronal - this uses complete species models,
including all levels, while grid_coronal uses the default.
There will be more cooling as a result, at a cost of more memory
and greater execution time.
This also serves as a test of the full Stout database
