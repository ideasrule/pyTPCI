This test case compares the predictions of the multi-level H-like O VIII atom
with the Storey and Hummer (1995) results.  The set dr command sets the
zone thickness to 1 cm.  The case b command sets Lyman line optical depths
to very large values. 
Checks:
-	Neutral fractions
-	H* emissivity
-	Relative line intensities
