func_trans_lumi, func_trans_save_lumi, and func_trans_read_lumi_scale are a
set of tests that check that the code can save a transmitted continuum in
luminosity mode and then read it back in.

func_trans_lumi.in: this sim is directly illuminated by a BB at Rin = 1e21.
  Its predictions should be identical to func_trans_read_lumi_scale.in.

func_trans_save_lumi.in: this sim is directly illuminated by a BB at Rin =
  1e20. It saves the transmitted continuum and has no monitors.

func_trans_read_lumi_scale.in: this sim is illiminated by the transmitted
  continuum at Rin = 1e21. Its predictions should be almost identical to
  func_trans_lumi.in. This tests that the transmitted continuum works
  correctly in luminosity mode and also that spherical dilution is handled
  correctly.
