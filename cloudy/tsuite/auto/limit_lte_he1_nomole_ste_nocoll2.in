test whether a gas dominated by He goes to LTE in a range of conditions.
The level populations should be in LTE, the departure coefficients
should be unity, and the temperature equal to the BB temp.

These are STE calculations with no collapsed levels, no collisions,
and no molecules, so these models should stringently test the
thermodynamic equilibrium limit of radiative coupling terms.
