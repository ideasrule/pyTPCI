This tests the radiative acceleration and terminal velocity of 
a wind in which only electron scattering is important.  The parameters
were chosen so that electron scattering is the dominant opacity source,
so that the equations can be solved both numerically (in the example)
and analytically (the expected solution given above).  In a realistic wind
the gas would be more neutral and line driving would dominate.  The force
multiplier, given in the save wind output, is nearly unity as a result.

Checks:
-	The radiative acceleration is correct (e- 9.543910-7 cm s-2).
-	The terminal velocity should be 7.57 km s-1.
-	Force multiplier near unity (no line driving since so highly ionized).
-	Thickness of cloud correct (R-Ro + dr/2 should be 3.086391017 cm).
