test
# The save command produces a file, LineLablels.txt, which contains
# the set of line labels for the standard Cloudy setup.  This file
# gives the species identification, the line wavelength, and indications
# of how the line was formed, or which database produced it.
save line labels "LineLabels.txt"
# this produces a file, SpeciesLabels.txt, which contains a list of 
# all species known to the code and the database used to model it.  
save species labels "SpeciesLabels.txt" all
# This reports the number of levels and the database used for each species.
