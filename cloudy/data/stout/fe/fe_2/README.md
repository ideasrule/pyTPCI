## Notes

Several datasets are provided for FeII.
The default at the moment is the
[Smyth et al. (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483..654S)
dataset.
Available are also recent, accurate calculations by
[Bautista et al. (2015)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...808..174B),
and
[Tayal et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PhRvA..98a2706T),
as well as the old
[Verner et al. (1999) model](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJS..120..101V).

[Sarkar et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907...12S)
compare these models and find that the Smyth19 model gives the best results.

To switch between various datasets, follow the instructions in the
[README file found in the data directory](../../../README_data.md).
