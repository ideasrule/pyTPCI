## fast.ini
##
## this ini file makes the code as fast as possible, at the expense
## of some loss of fidelity and stability.  The options are done
## with low density nebulae in mind.  The file was developed to
## aid in testing the code in the dynamics case, and the
## approximations are probably ok for that application.
## this file should not be included in any results intended for publication.

## this does not turn on grains - 
## to turn on the very fastest grains, at the expense of the physics, do
## grains single no qheat no physics

print off hide 
## include only elements with significant gas-phase abundances
## when grains are present - note, this does not include
## grains, which must be added separately
##
## abundance cut off is based on the elements previously turned off
